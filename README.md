# Calculus
Calculus looks to be an API that receives calculation requests and replies with an answer.

## Development
You can use docker compose to start up the development environment.
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Changes made to `app.py` will be available from `localhost:5000` being passed through from the container.
